# Dotfiles

I am using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage the installation
of my dotfiles. It is a great tool, so I highly recommend!

### Usage:

1. Clone this repo

2. For a new machine, move the default or existing dotfiles to a backup directory.

3. Run `./install` from within the repo to automatically set up the development environment using Dotbot. This will not overwrite existing files as currently configured, however, it will not succeed if there are existing files of the same name in the installation path.
