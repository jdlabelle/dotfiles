# Notes on Arch Linux / Hyprland setup

## Waybar

I use the following config without many changes: [mechabar](https://github.com/sejjy/mechabar.git)

## Theme

Due to availability and comparability to my current favorite theme (TokyoNight), the overall theme I use is [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin).

I use themes for:
- gtk (via nwg-look)
- qt (via kvantum)
- rofi
- waybar
- hyprland
- yazi

Might pivot to Gruvbox or Kanagawa in the future, both are sick colorschemes.
